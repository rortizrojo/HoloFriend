# HoloFriend

## Holographic simulation of a pet for the Microsoft Hololens.

***
The application is a simulation of a holographic avatar made in Unity3D and modeled with Blender.Â  

* The avatar responds to various commands by voice
* It moves around the user's environment and interacts with it, detecting walls and obstacles to generate the shortest path between the avatar and the fixed objective.
* The avatar consists of several states depending on the interaction the user makes with it.

A holographic mascot has been implemented as an avatar. A simple 3D model of a Dalmatian with a small set of animations has been made. 

* The pet obeys orders such as "sit", "up", "give me a paw".
* Toys are sent to him that he will search and bring back to the place where the user is. 
* The pet may be tired, happy or angry depending on the amount of hunger, energy or play interaction.
