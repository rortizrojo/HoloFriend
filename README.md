# HoloFriend

Holographic simulation of an avatar for the Microsoft Hololens.

The application consists of a holographic avatar that responds to various commands by voice, moves through the user's environment and interacts with it, detecting walls and obstacles to generate the shortest path between the avatar and the set objective. The avatar consists of several states depending on the interaction the user makes with it.

A holographic mascot has been implemented as an avatar. A simple 3D model of a Dalmatian with a small set of animations has been made. The pet obeys orders such as "sit", "up", "give me a paw", toys are sent to him that he will search and bring back to the place where the user is. The pet may be tired, happy or angry depending on the amount of hunger, energy or play interaction.
